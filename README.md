## Project title
Assigment 3
Aim of this project is to enhance problem solving using R coding and working together as a team. This project is a combinationof Git hub and Rstudio where Git hub is the version control.
This project anaysis the two data sets(gene_expression.tsv which contain RNA sequence and growth_data.tsv which contain themeasurements for the tree circumference growing at two sites. 
gene_expression.tsv contain RNA sequence of two sites and growth_data.tsv contains measurements for tree circumference growing at two sites, control site and treatment site which were planted 20 years ago.


## Motivation
To practice R studio and Git hub collaberation.

## Contents
gene_expression.tsv-data set for RNA sequence of two samples of interest
README.md
growth_data.csv-contains measurements for tree circumference growing at two sites, control site and treatment site which were planted 20 years ago
## Installation
